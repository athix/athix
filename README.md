Hello world! I currently maintain the open source ruby gem 'Sorcery', and work
on various other projects, most of which I try to open source as well.

If you need to reach out to me, please either create an issue on the appropriate
project repository, or connect with me on LinkedIn.

My major projects are still a WIP, and are private for the time being. For now,
here are some examples of my work that you can view:

## Libraries

* [Sorcery v1 Rework](https://github.com/sorcery/sorcery-rework)

## Microcontroller Projects

* [Stepper Motor Music](https://github.com/athix/stepper-motor-music)
* [MCU PPM Input](https://github.com/athix/mcu-ppm-input)
* [Shift Register Chasing Lights](https://github.com/athix/shift-register-stuff)

## Misc
